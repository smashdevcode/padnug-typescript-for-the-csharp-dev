# TypeScript for the C\# Dev

Here's the situation: You're an experienced C# developer and you're a master at developing applications using Visual Studio. But now you're tasked with working on a project where more than 2/3 of the code will be written in JavaScript. No problem, right? You dive in and well, things start to get out of control. If only developing applications in JavaScript was more like developing applications using C#. You hear about this thing called TypeScript...

Will TypeScript solve all of your problems? What exactly is TypeScript and how does it work? How do you get started with using TypeScript? Will it keep you from having to take the time to gain a deep understanding of JavaScript?

In this talk, we'll take a look at how TypeScript can help ease the development of JavaScript-based applications. We'll review what will feel familiar to you as a C# developer, and what might surprise you. And we'll take a look at some of the common mistakes that developers make when learning TypeScript (and by extension, JavaScript).
